                         Downloading files using the XDCC bots

If you watch that channel you will see these ads show - they look something like this:-

You can queue on the xdcc servers by typing a special command in the #Moviegods channel.

Let's say you wanted "Cowboys.And.Aliens.2011.EXTENDED.720p.BluRay.x264-CROSSBOW.tar" from this xdcc bot. 

The #4 after [mg]-BotName is the pack number of that file. 

To request this file you would type this:  /msg [mg]-BotName xdcc send #4

You will then be queued on that xdccbot for that file.  Then you just wait and the download will start automatically 

when there is an open slot. Make sure you turn on auto get in your mIRC options.


You must be in #Moviegods and #MG-Chat to download from the bots. 

You must stay in #Moviegods and #MG-Chat until your download completes.

If you leave #Moviegods or #MG-Chat your download will be terminated and you will have to rejoin and re-request your file.

                            Passive Bots
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


If you are trying to download from a bot with a |P| or P- this means the bot is using passive dcc. 

You will need to change some settings in your router, ie port forward or DMZ yourself.


Login to your router and go to Port Forwarding and forward the following ports to your network ip address - 5001-5010

Or

You can go to DMZ and point it at your network ip.


5001-5010 is your dcc port range. You can use any range you like we just picked this range as an example. 

The default range is 1024-5000. 

You need 1 port for every send/get/dcc chat. A range of 10 should be more than enough for the average user. 


Set your ports in mIRC by typing Alt+O then going to Connect > Options > Advanced or Ports(depending on your mIRC version)

and input your range.


You will also have to allow the same ports in your firewall software. 

(Before you say you dont have one... windows firewall?)



If you are a behind a router you will need to force mIRC to use your ip/hostname instead of 192.168.x.x/PCName
 
You can input your ip/hostname by typing  Alt+O then going to Connect > Local


Then manually enter your ip and hostname

Or 

check both boxes and select "Server Lookup Method"
 


If you are using any kind of proxy, YOU MUST 

Uncheck both boxes and Manually enter your ip/hostname
